<p>Well for us, it happened somewhere in between being totally transparent and working the way we want, while always aspiring to outdo our best. It grew in between building, creating, managing, and always laughing along the way. It expanded as we integrated and automated, built workflows and created templates, and developed our community beyond our wildest dreams. We experienced firsthand how much more we can accomplish when we really, truly work in an organized manner.We experienced how deeply empowering it is to build our own workflows with customizable building blocks.
